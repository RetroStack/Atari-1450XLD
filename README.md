# Atari 1450XLD – Recreated Case

**WARNING:** This repository is a work in progress and parts of the case most likely will change!  

This project provides a fully recreated case for the Atari 1450XLD, designed for 3D printing. The original 1450XLD never went into mass production, and surviving prototypes are rare. This repository offers a way to reproduce the case with several thoughtful improvements compared to the original design.

## Improvements Over the Original

- **Removed unnecessary holes** in the enclosure for a cleaner look.  
- **Removed the unused bottom hatch**, making the case more robust.  
- **Added a removable port cover**, inspired by the Atari 1200, for easier access and modularity.
